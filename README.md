# ✅ Basic Todo List with Status Filter

This project is a simple Todo List simulation using pure JavaScript (no HTML, no browser input fields). It organizes tasks into two categories:

- ✅ **Completed Tasks**
- ⏳ **Ongoing Tasks**

All task data is stored in a JavaScript array and displayed in the console.

---

## 🧠 Project Features

- Todo items are stored as objects with two properties:
  - `title`: Name of the task
  - `done`: `true` if completed, `false` if ongoing
- Uses `filter()` to separate completed and ongoing tasks
- Uses `forEach()` to print all tasks clearly in the console
- Clean and readable JavaScript code with comments
